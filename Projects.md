## TestFlakes: “Copying with Test Flakiness”. Fonds National de la Researche Luxembourg - CORE.

This is an FNR CORE funding, supporting two PhD students and a PostDoc. The project is about developing techniques and tools capable of maximising the testing value in the presence of test false alarms in the context of continuous integration. In particular, the project will identify the problems caused by the test suite non-determinism and will built techniques capable of copying with this issue (operate and provide decision making under uncertainty). In summary, the goal of the project is:
a) to investigate the impact of non-determinism on testing (what is impacted and how)
b) develop techniques to detect and diagnose non-deterministic failures (determine the cer- tainty/uncertainty of the provided signal)
c) leverage these findings by developing flaky-tolerant techniques (provide reasoning in the presence of noisy uncertain signal).
All in all, the TestFlakes project aims at providing ways for mitigating the effects of flaky tests when performing Continuous Integration software development process.

Duration: 3 years: from 01-06-2021 to 30-05-2024.
